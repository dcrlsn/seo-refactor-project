## Description
The site originally was not using semantic elements and was lacking accessibility alt text and descriptions. The assets were also massively oversized for their use on the site. Many of the CSS classes were also redundant.

## Refactoring
The images were resized to twice the height or width defined by the CSS. Divs were replaced with semantic elements. Alt and meta descriptions were added where necessary. Unnecessary classes were deleted or replaced with ids. The CSS was also condensed and removed of redundant entries.
